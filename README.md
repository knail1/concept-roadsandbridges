Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure
https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/

excerpt from the article:
_Our modern society runs on software. But the tools we use to build software are buckling under increased demand._

_Nearly all software today relies on free, public code, written and maintained by communities of developers and other talent. This code can be used by anyone—from companies to individuals—to write their own software. Shared, public code makes up the digital infrastructure of our society today.
... In a world driven by technology, we are putting increased demand on those who maintain our digital infrastructure. Yet because these communities are not highly visible, the rest of the world has been slow to notice._

_Just like physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure needs regular upkeep and maintenance. 
...No individual company or organization is incentivized to address the public good problem alone. In order to support our digital infrastructure, we must find ways to work together._


## details
This came about while brainstorming for a course project. While we dropped this idea (too ambitious, and not enough front end), I want to take develop this in the opensource space.
I expand on this project with illustrations here (look for the relevant project tab for details)

## what this project accomplishes
What this project accomplishes:	goals
1. helps critical but impoverished opensource core repos (and their owners) the paople  are struggling to fix defects and do their day jobs 	public good!
2. promotes open source proliferation (Viren may have just needed the push and the public recognition to contribute his time and smarts back to open source,	dissemination
3. (optional) does some NLP stuff when reading the comments of the issues 	analysis
4. (probabilistic) what is the probability of success of this connection (and models or methods that can be used)	analysis
5. integrating different sources - DVA building blocks using multiple data sources (libraries.io, github, stackoverflow) 	integration
6. visually show the correlation of issues, fixing, the repos in threat, etc	visualization
7. guess we'll have to create a presentaiton anyway!	presentation
